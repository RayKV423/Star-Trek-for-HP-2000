# Star-Trek-for-HP-2000
This is the earliest surviving code of [Star Trek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)) created by Mark Mayfield. This version of Star Trek written in [HP Time-Shared BASIC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Time-Shared_BASIC) for [HP 2000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_2100#HP_2000) by Mayfield in 1972 as the original code of the very first version of Star Trek written by Mayfield the previous year (which is just punched tape) is lost.

This code came from this [archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120719123315/http://www.dunnington.u-net.com/public/startrek/STTR1) thanks to the [Medium article that I found](https://medium.com/swlh/code-archaeology-with-super-star-trek-928101eb010c).
